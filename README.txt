README for insertsort.cpp and mergesort.cpp

1) Create a file called data.txt and place it within the same file as insertsort.cpp and mergesort.cpp.
2) In data.txt create your test array data using the following format with the first number being the
        total number of integers in the remainder of the array. That first number will not be included in
        the sorting:
            5 1 5 2 4 3
            3 1 5 2
            10 1 821 571 12 1 6 12 1 22 2
            15 7 1 8 20 31 10 26 218 21 1 06 12 1281 14 2
3) You can include multiple arrays as long as the are on separate lines.
4) Run insertsort.cpp or mergesort.cpp
5) The cpp file will parse the data.txt file and sort the arrays.
6) You will see a new file named "insertout.txt" or "mergeout.txt" containing the sorted values of the arrays.
